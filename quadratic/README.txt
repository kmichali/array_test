Hands-on problem for array runs

In current directory:
1) python script that solves a quadratic equation 
if you assume ax^2+bx+c=0, you can solve the equation running "python quadratic_args.py a b c > solution"
2) submit script that submits the above command to PBS cluster manager
3) file "input_data" with a list of inputs for quadratic_args.py


Your task:
Write a submit script that uses an array run and solves all inputs in input_data.

Happy computing!
